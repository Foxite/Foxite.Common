If your agent actually has to explore the map: Greedy Best First (NOTE: probably need to modify it to integrate its frontier exploration with your agent)
Otherwise,
If you want to get a path from and to exactly one location: A*
If you want to get a path from or to all locations:
- If costs are the same everywhere: Breadth-first
- If costs vary: Dijkstra
